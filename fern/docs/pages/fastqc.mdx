**1. Log In and Setup Workspace:**

Start by logging into your Darwin account.
Navigate to your workspace or create a new one if you haven't set one up yet.

**2. Upload Your Data: **

Go to the 'Data' section within your workspace.
Click on 'Upload Data' and select your sequencing files (typically FASTQ format) from your computer or connected storage.

**3. Access FASTQC Tool:**

In the Darwin dashboard, search for the FASTQC tool from the list of available tools or use the search bar to find it quickly.

**4. Configure FASTQC Parameters:**

Click on FASTQC to open its configuration settings.
Upload your sequencing files to the tool or select the already uploaded files.
Set any specific parameters required for your analysis, though the default settings are generally sufficient for a standard quality check.

**5. Run the Analysis and Review Results:**

Once you've configured all settings, submit your job for analysis by clicking the 'Run' button.
After the analysis completes, you can view the FASTQC reports directly on Darwin. These reports will include various quality metrics such as per base sequence quality, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented sequences which are crucial for assessing the quality of your sequencing data.
