**1. Log In and Set Up Your Environment:**
Sign into your Darwin account and navigate to your workspace. Create a new project or select an existing one where you will conduct the RFDiffusion analysis.

**2. Upload Your Data:**
Upload your dataset into the workspace. RFDiffusion might require specific types of input data, so ensure your files are formatted correctly and contain all necessary information for diffusion modeling.

**3. Access the RFDiffusion Tool:**
Find RFDiffusion in Darwin’s library of tools. If it’s available as a predefined tool, you can select it; otherwise, you might need to set it up manually using a script or a notebook provided by Darwin or developed by your team.

**4. Configure the Analysis Parameters:**
Set up your RFDiffusion parameters. This may involve specifying the model configuration, diffusion parameters, and any other relevant settings that the analysis requires. If you’re using a script, this will typically involve editing parameter values within the script.

**5. Run the Analysis and Review Results:**
Execute the analysis by running the tool. Monitor the process for completion and any errors that might occur.
Once the analysis is complete, review the output. RFDiffusion will typically generate outputs that could include visualizations, statistical summaries, or predictive insights based on your data.
