**1. Log In and Set Up Your Environment:**

Sign into your Darwin account. Navigate to your workspace where you will conduct the analysis. If necessary, create a new workspace tailored for your current project.

**2. Upload and Prepare Your Data:**

Upload your single-cell RNA sequencing data files to the workspace. These could be in formats such as .csv, .txt, or a matrix file. Ensure the data is clean and appropriately formatted for analysis.

**3. Access the Seurat Tool:**

Search for the Seurat tool in the Darwin tool library. Darwin may have an interface for configuring and running Seurat directly, or you might need to use a script editor if you are customizing the analysis steps.

**4. Configure Seurat Parameters:**

Set up your analysis by specifying parameters in Seurat. This includes steps like normalizing the data, identifying highly variable features, and scaling the data. You may need to input commands or select options, depending on Darwin's user interface.

**5. Run Seurat, Interpret Results:**

Execute the analysis. Seurat will perform clustering, dimensionality reduction (like PCA and t-SNE or UMAP), and might generate plots and statistics to help interpret the data.
Once complete, review the output for insights into cell populations, gene expression patterns, and potential biomarkers.
